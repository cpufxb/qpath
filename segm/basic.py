# BOUNDING_BOX

    BOUNDING_BOX: extracts the coordinates of the bounding box of an object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image: a 2D image (ndarray): everything above <th> is considered foreground.
        No test for connectiveness is performed.

    th: integer
        The threshold above which a pixel is considered to belong to an
        object. Defaults to 0.

        the coordinates upper-left and lower-right of the bounding box
